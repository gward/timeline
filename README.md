# timeline

timeline is a JavaScript app (using React) for showing the evolution of a scene over time. Maybe you want to take a picture of your garden every week for a year, or of a house being built. In my case, we had renovations done and I wanted to capture the process for posterity. So I wrote timeline.

Probably the best way to understand what it does is to visit the instance I created for those renovations: http://timeline.gerg.ca/.
